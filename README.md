cloud9 enviornment, and the all scripted log messages are specific to the createstuff
workspace.

### Things still to-do ###

* Make build script messages detect Localhost v. Cloud9
* Make build script messages detect the Cloud9 workspace
* Complete CRUD actions on the mockApi
* Create a starter-kit backend server - and have it serve the users resource
* Make the baseUrl file point to deployed backend API instead of mockApi
